     *  creation according to specified camera. The descriptor is needed for
     *  queries on calibration values.
     *
     *  The descriptor has to be empty because memory pointer carried by the
     *  structure are erased by the function.
     *
     *  The function returns LF_FALSE if creation failed, LF_TRUE otherwise.
